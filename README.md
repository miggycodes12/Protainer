# Protainer
Protainer is a fully open-source C++ program mainly utilizing the SFML3 and OpenGL libraries. It is a simplistic window based GUI and its main purpose is to contain and showcase personal C++ projects of mine. Sort of like a project hub. The name comes from combining the words "Project" and "Container" together for any of the curious.

# Developer Note | Protainer Development #2 (5/26/2025)
Protainer is currently well deep in the early development phase. I will publish pre-releases soon and I hope to get the first pre-release into the repository at Early June. I have a final exam on May 29th and I'll have a busy house moving day at the end of May too. So I've postponed the pre-release quite a bit and by Early June, you can probably expect it at June 5 or 6. About the projects it will contain, I plan these projects to be significant/complex and are not simple projects. The projects will take me lots of effort and time to program (likely) and projects are developed one at a time. I am not starting multiple large projects at the same time and developing them and allocating time and effort. I feel like this method of building can impact the quality of the projects so I decided to focus on one until the core features are finished. Updates on projects will happen but it becomes a 2-way decision on updating an existing project or start a new project. For this decision I do lean toward starting new projects but I will update projects that I really like. Game like projects will tend to recieve patches or content updates.

Fixed Dev Message: The software is programmed under Linux (Arch to be specifically, hahaha) and I have so far programmed some code that identifies the current path of the main folder containing all of the files and stuff to run Protainer, regardless of the user's operating system. So this should be cross-platform as none of the code directly references OS exclusive path enviornments. Also, this is a PASSION PROJECT. I have school and I get tired and I'm not entirely dedicated to the development of this project.
