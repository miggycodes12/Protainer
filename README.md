# Protainer
Protainer is a fully open-source C++ program mainly utilizing the SFML3 and OpenGL libraries. It is a simplistic window based GUI and its main purpose is to contain and showcase personal C++ projects of mine. Sort of like a project hub. The name comes from combining the words "Project" and "Container" together for any of the curious.
