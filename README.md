# Protainer
Protainer is a fully open-source C++ program mainly utilizing the SFML3 and OpenGL libraries. It is a simplistic window based GUI and its main purpose is to contain and showcase personal C++ projects of mine. Anyone is entirely free to personalize the program and its files for their own projects hubs or Protainer mods. 

# Developer Note | Protainer Development #4 (6/22/2025)
During the time of writing, the debug instance panel feature have been initialized along with a user text input system. After writing these features, I've stopped development for about 5 days-ish. Mainly because I'm lazy but oh well. Anyway, I've continued development upon writing this dev note. Other core features such as the installer script that was planned last dev note will be added in the successive version of v0.8. Otherwise, the hard part is done for v0.8 and I just need to create some new hub pages for the up-coming projects and fill these pages in with stuff.

Fixed Dev Message: The software is programmed under Linux (Arch to be specifically, hahaha) and I have so far programmed some code that identifies the current path of the main folder containing all of the files and stuff to run Protainer, regardless of the user's operating system. So this should be cross-platform as none of the code directly references OS exclusive path enviornments. Also, this is a PASSION PROJECT. I have school and I get tired and I'm not entirely dedicated to the development of this project.
