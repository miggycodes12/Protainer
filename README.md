# Protainer
Protainer is a fully open-source C++ program mainly utilizing the SFML3 and OpenGL libraries. It is a simplistic window based GUI and its main purpose is to contain and showcase personal C++ projects of mine. Sort of like a project hub. The name comes from combining the words "Project" and "Container" together for any of the curious.

# Developer Note | Protainer Development (5/22/2025)
Protainer is currently still deep in the very early development phase. No projects have been created on the GUI at the moment as I'm still working on the core mechanics. I will publish the source code once I've created some projects on the GUI. Before I get any hopes too high, please note that once published, the interface design will have barely any aesthetics and it is super simplistic. You will be greeted with a mainly white interface that is navigated by scrolling up and down. Buttons are literally just italicized and underlined text objects. Why am I designing it like this? Well my priorities for this project are the projects within the GUI that you can access, not the GUI itself. The GUI is programmed to have the most minimal looking design in order to begin the development process of the real projects within it as soon as possible.

Also, regarding my experience with C++, I don't even have a couple months worth of hands-on-experience. I've actually started learning C++ by just reading the W3Schools articles. So don't be too shocked on how the code is structured. I try my best to keep it as readable and organized as possible but either way, its going to definitely have some form of messy code or formatting throughout the long development road ahead for this project.

Fixed Dev Message: The software is programmed under Linux (Arch to be specifically, hahaha) and I have so far programmed some code that identifies the current path of the main folder containing all of the files and stuff to run Protainer, regardless of the user's operating system. So this should be cross-platform as none of the code directly references OS exclusive path enviornments. Also, this is a PASSION PROJECT. I have school and I get tired and I'm not entirely dedicated to the development of this project.
