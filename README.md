# Protainer
Protainer is a fully open-source C++ program mainly utilizing the SFML3 and OpenGL libraries. It is a simplistic window based GUI and its main purpose is to contain and showcase personal C++ projects of mine. Sort of like a project hub. The name comes from combining the words "Project" and "Container" together for any of the curious.

# Developer Note | Protainer Development #2 (5/26/2025)
Protainer is currently well deep in the early development phase. I will publish pre-releases soon and I hope to get the first pre-release into the repository at Early June. I have a final exam on May 29th and I'll have a busy house moving day at the end of May too. So I've postponed the pre-release quite a bit and by Mid June, you can probably expect it at June 11 or 12 (*new, Early July) as I need some time to move into a new home. About the projects it will contain, I plan these projects to be significant/complex and are not simple projects. The projects will take me lots of effort and time to program (likely) and projects are developed one at a time. I am not starting multiple large projects at the same time and developing them and allocating time and effort. I feel like this method of building can impact the quality of the projects so I decided to focus on one until the core features are finished. Updates on projects will happen but it becomes a 2-way decision on updating an existing project or start a new project. For this decision I do lean toward starting new projects but I will update projects that I really like. Game like projects will tend to recieve patches or content updates.

Fixed Dev Message: The software is programmed under Linux (Arch to be specifically, hahaha) and I have so far programmed some code that identifies the current path of the main folder containing all of the files and stuff to run Protainer, regardless of the user's operating system. So this should be cross-platform as none of the code directly references OS exclusive path enviornments. Also, this is a PASSION PROJECT. I have school and I get tired and I'm not entirely dedicated to the development of this project.

# Side Note from Dev | Protainer v0.8 delayed (6/6/25)
Due to certain circumstances, I lost about 5 days to develop Protainer. Do note that for a day I work on this project, I spend atleast a couple of hours. Plans have changed a lot during this time of static development and I'm overhauling and reworking the main script as its pretty cluttered with class and function definitions. The main problem is that these definitions aren't effectively re-usable by entirely different C++ scripts and re-pasting them is just too messy. I would say that the reworking wouldn't take too too long and the rest of the time developing is adding more features. With the plans I have at the time of writing this, I would say v0.8 would take the month of June so I would say its publishing date will linger in **Early July**. Also school is close to coming to an end for me I will have lots of time developing Protainer in the summer break.
